### Abstract
This report details an AI-driven classification task aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The study employed Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Tree models to classify individuals based on various clinical features. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values through mode imputation and converting the multi-class target variable into a binary format (presence or absence of heart disease). Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The comparative analysis revealed varying strengths and weaknesses among the models, highlighting their suitability for different aspects of heart disease prediction. This research contributes to understanding the applicability of common machine learning algorithms in healthcare diagnostics.
